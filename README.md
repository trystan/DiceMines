DiceMines
===================

A dice-based and party-based 2014 7drl by Trystan Spangler.

Form a team of heroes to go into the dice mines, survive the baddies, and come back with more dice. Or whatever - there's no real goal. Make sure your team has the right stats, abilities, equipment, and personalities for the job.

You should probably download the Flash Standalone Player and use that rather than running it in your browser.

Also, it is possible to end up in an area you can't get out of. If you have a bow then you can shoot yourself until you die. Otherwise, restart. No one said the dice mines were easy.
